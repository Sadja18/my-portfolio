# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects, skills, and experience as a Full Stack Developer. The portfolio is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and it features a clean, modern design with a dark mode toggle.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is fully responsive and works seamlessly on all devices.
- **Dark Mode:** A dark mode toggle is available for a comfortable viewing experience.
- **Dynamic Content:** The portfolio content is dynamically generated from data in the `App.tsx` file, making it easy to update.
- **Framer Motion:** The portfolio uses Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions.
- **Lucide Icons:** The portfolio uses Lucide Icons for clean and modern icons.

There is one thing I want you to know about my resume and the portfolio site which I face while applying.
My skill and expertise is quite diverse. But not technically literate people do hiring using ATS.
So, everytime I need to apply for a job (on any portal), I need to create/update one of the various versions of my resume, update my portfolio site, rebuild it, and reupload on firebase.

That is why, I maintain the resume in markdown, and have the site has dynamic section like below:

Do you understand what I wrote? if yes, explain
----

I want something more feature rich.

A single website, where I have following features:
1. Resume management: 
  1. CRUD using WYSIWYG editor (preferably markdown, because that way, I can add basic css because markdown supports html)
  2. Dynamic URLs for resume PDF
  3. Media storage for PDFs (I have a google drive but want to avoid paid google cloud billing.): I can get away with storing the markdown as text in sqlite db table, but for the generated PDFs (especially if I wanna allow download link in portfolio), I would need external media storage.
2. Portfolio site management:
    1. Each resume would have its own portfolio website in same UI layout.
    2. Different site urls (I dont know how to achieve this) for separate portfolios.

Do you understand this. if yes, explain what I am wondering feasibility of.
---

What if I have something less manual work.

Like asking which role portfolio I want, 
then for that specific portfolio, I would get separate sections:
1. Profile Pic
2. Headline (Optional)
3. About : with option to specify whether to have same or different content in resume and portfolio site
4. Experience: with sub fields: role, duration, location, bullets, and tech.
5. Skills, with similar flow: frontend, backend, languages, cloud, databases, mobile, security, data
6. get in touch section: with option to specify whether to have same or different content in resume and portfolio site
7. footer: with option to specify whether to have same or different content in resume and portfolio site

Now, I dont want code, but its feasibility and comparability to the flow I suggested before?
---

I am using firebase studio (formerly project IDX), simply because windows causes problems for filewatcher for both nodejs, and python while debug development (crashing, and port still busy on restarts).

In firebase studio, I have option to develop in python flask, python django, nextjs, node express, laravel.
I am confused on which to use (next js seems overkill for simple UI with bootstrap css). I can use turso for free sqlite db as I wouldnt have that much data. But for security, I would prefer to have some kind of user auth (which I can implement later)
Which to go with is a question, but before that, I would like to know how do other projs do dynamic URLs for subsites like my project requires and whether I would need domain registration for it?

---

Okay, so Django with DTL it is
let us go with flow 2 which I thought
```
What if I have something less manual work.

Like asking which role portfolio I want, 
then for that specific portfolio, I would get separate sections:
1. Profile Pic
2. Headline (Optional)
3. About : with option to specify whether to have same or different content in resume and portfolio site
4. Experience: with sub fields: role, duration, location, bullets, and tech.
5. Skills, with similar flow: frontend, backend, languages, cloud, databases, mobile, security, data
6. get in touch section: with option to specify whether to have same or different content in resume and portfolio site
7. footer: with option to specify whether to have same or different content in resume and portfolio site
```

First, let us divide the full project MVP into implementable modules.
Module section 1
1. Dynamic data entry for using basic section based fields
2. Resume preview and downloader without saving PDF
3. Portfolio preview without dynamic URL

Module Section 2
1. dynamic URL for resume
2. dynamic URL for portfolio
3. Resume would have portfolio URL, portfolio would have resume URL

Module section 3
1. Publicly accessible URLs
2. User auth

the django project template from firebase studio gives following proj structure:
